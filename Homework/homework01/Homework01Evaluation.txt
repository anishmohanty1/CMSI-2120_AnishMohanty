Homework01 Evaluation
======================
For homework01, the focus is to make sure that your GitHub repository is set
up and that your Java environment is installed and working properly.  The
actual programming part of the assignment is trivial, just a simple program
to display "Hello World!" on the terminal window.

Since this is also the in-class assignment for week01, you should have the
code in at least one or the other of the two places.  I will locate it and
make sure it appears in both locations if it is only in one at no cost.

The other part of this is to make sure you have the individual directory
structure [folder hierarchy] set up in your repo.  If this is not correctly
done, I will fix it for you at the cost of one point.

scores:
=============================
Folder structure for classwork      4 out of 4 pts.
Folder structure for homework       3 out of 4 pts.
'Greeter.java' program committed    0 out of 4 pts.
'Greeter.java' program compiles     0 out of 4 pts.
'Greeter.java' program runs         0 out of 4 pts.

Total possible score: 20 out of 20 for 100%

Your score: 7 out of 20 which is 35.0% which is an F

Comments:

I don't know what happened here, Anish, but if there is nothing in your repo
there's not much I can do.  Not an auspicious beginning, to say the least.

Perhaps I can be of help to you to get you started, or if you would like to
consult with me I'm happy to meet with you during office hours.  You can also
visit the Keck Lab in Doolan hall, room 112 where there are many TA's and
other students who can help you if you don't understand anything.  Please do
not hesitate to contact me if I can help you in ANY way, and I will do my
best to assist you!

I put in a copy of my solution to homework01, along with my solution to the
'PiSolver.java' program which was optional but is informative to read.

Your classwork folder structure is set correctly, just not with all of the
folders you'll need.  That's OK, though, full credit for that.  I had to
create your 'homework' folder structure, though.

On to homework02!
